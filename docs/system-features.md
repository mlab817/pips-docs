# System Features

## General Features.

The PIP System is currently hosted by web hosting provider (Z.com) which uses cPanel. The backend system was built using 
[PHP-Laravel](https://laravel.com) as a REST API provider. The frontend was built using [React](https://reactjs.org) and
[Ant Design](https://ant.design). The mobile application was built using [ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev).

The system can be run in any browser that supports javascript. For best results, however, please use Google Chrome or 
other Chrome-based browsers, e.g. Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.

## Security Features.

Only authorized users will be able to access the system through the username and password
provided. System logs, which contain electronic record of transactions/interactions in the
system, will be generated by the system to ensure accountability on information encoded in
the system.
