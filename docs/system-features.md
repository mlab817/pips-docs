# System Features

## General Features

The PIP System is currently hosted by web hosting provider (Z.com) which uses cPanel. The backend system was built using 
[PHP-Laravel](https://laravel.com) as a REST API provider. The frontend was built using [React](https://reactjs.org) and
[Ant Design](https://ant.design). The mobile application was built using [ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev).

The system can be run in any browser that supports javascript. For best results, however, please use Google Chrome or 
other Chrome-based browsers, e.g. Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.

The frontend application of the PIPS is a single page application. Below is an illustration
of how this makes the PIPS more responsive to users.

## Security Features

Only authorized users will be able to access the system through the username and password
provided. System logs, which contain electronic record of transactions/interactions in the
system, will be generated by the system to ensure accountability on information encoded in
the system.

The system uses JWT token to authenticate requests from client side (i.e. browser). This token
is stored in the client's LocalStorage and is valid for 12 hours. This means that users need
not login every time within the last 12 hours when using the system.

:::warning
When using the application in a computer that is used by other people, users are **strongly urged**
to log out their application manually.
