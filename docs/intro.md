# Introduction

## About the System

The Public Investment Program (PIP) System is an online database system that
manages data entry and updates on priority program and projects (PAPs) under the Public
Investment Program (PIP), which includes the PIP's Core Investment Programs and
Projects (CIPs), non-CIPs, and Three-Year Rolling Infrastructure Program (TRIP), as well
as the generation of PIP/CIP/TRIP-related reports. The system is designed to: (i) allow
online submission by operating units of information regarding their priority PAPs, including
project details and status updates; (ii) allow the DA Secretariat to review and validate
operating unit submissions; and (iii) assist the DA Secretariat in generating reports.

Operating units shall be guided by the DA Memorandum on the call for the submission of
PAPs in the Updated 2023-2028 PIP. Copy of the PIP call and its attachments can be accessed
in the PIPS website.

The current PIP System is the __third__ version of the system developed by the DA-Investment 
Programming Division that incorporates improvement in the process of the PIP/TRIP formulation and 
updating. Major enhancements in the System include the following:

1. Enhanced system security and bug fixes, 
2. Support for activity-level data collection for regular programs under OSEC which can be downloaded for consolidation,
3. Automated checks for data completion and consistency for project profile, activity logging, comment section, and PIPOL entry form,
4. Enhanced data visualization in dashboard,
5. Dedicated tracker page for project submissions by staff assigned and by office, and
6. Mobile version.

## General Process Flow, User Administration and Management

1. DA operating units, including central office units, project management offices,
regional field offices, bureaus, attached agencies, government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), 
encode PAPs for inclusion in the PIP and/or TRIP through the System (Encoder). Offices may request additional 
accounts for lower-level offices (e.g. regional coordinators).

2. The Investment Programming Division (IPD), as DA-PIP Secretariat, validates operating units' submission (Validators).

3. Further, the IPD  serves as the administrator of the PIP System and overall coordinator for PIP-related concerns,
   respectively (Administrator).
