# Issues

Upon saving any changes in the PAP profile, the system automatically validates the inputs of the user and generates
a list of issues/observations. This can serve as a guide for the encoder and the reviewer in reviewing their inputs.

:::tip
While it makes sense to aim for ZERO issues in the submission, this may NOT be achievable as some issues may not be
resolved at the encoder level. For example, the system may detect duplicate PAP against another office's PAP which
is not accessible to the encoder. This should be left up to the reviewer to resolve.

Likewise, some information may be correct but the system detects it as an inconsistency maybe due to unavailability of
the data at the time of encoding. In this case, the encoder should at least be prepared to explain the situation to the
reviewer. For example, inconsistency between breakdown by funding source and list of fund sources (e.g. breakdown by
fund source may not be available at this time).
