# Review and Validation

The IPD, as the DA PIP/TRIP Secretariat, conducts initial review and validation of the PAPs submitted in the PIPS in 
consultation with concerned operating units. The review and validation cover the following:

1. The PAP passes the inclusion/exclusion criteria as set by these and NEDAâ€™s guidelines;

2. Completeness, i.e. whether all required data fields are filled up;

3. Consistency (consolidated figures vs. breakdown) of the data fields:

4. Consultation with other DA agencies that may have better technical capability to assess the PAP particularly national commodity and functional focals;

5. Cross-validation with other reference documents, e.g. NAFMIP, MYP, roadmaps, sectoral plans, budget documents (NEP, GAA, PBP), etc.; and

6. Alignment of the PAPs to the PDP Chapters and PDP RM indicators.

The review and validation form can be accessed in the edit PIP/TRIP/CIP page.

At the bottom is the final validation check which will determine whether the PAP passes the overall validation
or not. If yes, the PAP will be marked as validated.

:::info
It is possible to mark the PAP as validated without passing all the checks. However, the form still requires
that all remarks are filled in case that the overall validation status needs to be reviewed.
