__Note:__ After multiple failed attempts to log-in to the System, the user will be temporarily
locked out from logging in for security purposes. The user may use the "Forgot Password?" feature
to recover their password. An email will be sent to the email registered of the user with instructions
on how to reset their password.

4. Upon log-in, the user will be directed to the Dashboard. Posted in the Dashboard are
   information for the userâ€™s reference such as the quick statistics and visualization of 
   the data inputted in the PIP System. __Note:__ Only data submitted in the Project module
   are reflected in the dashboard.

   The modules that can be accessed by the currently logged-in user vary depending on the type of the user (i.e.,
